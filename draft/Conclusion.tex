\section{Conclusion}
One of the most challenging problem of federated learning is the poor network connection as the workers are geo-distributed and connected with slow WAN. To avoid the drawback of high possibility network congestion in centralized parameter sever architecture, which is adopted in today's FL systems, we explore the possibility of decentralized FL solution, called \sys. Taking the insight that the peer-to-peer bandwidth is much smaller than the worker's maximum network capacity, \sys could fully utilize the bandwidth by saturating the network with segmented gossip aggregation. The experiments show that \sys significantly reduces the training time and remains good convergence performance.
%but still has good convergence.
