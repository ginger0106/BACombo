\begin{abstract}

The emerging concern about data privacy and security has motivated the proposal of \emph{federated learning}, which allows nodes to only synchronize the locally-trained models instead their own original data. Conventional federated learning architecture, inherited from the parameter server design, relies on highly centralized topologies and the assumption of large nodes-to-server bandwidths. However, in real-world federated learning scenarios the network capacities between nodes are highly uniformly distributed and smaller than that in a datacenter. It is of great challenges for conventional federated learning approaches to efficiently utilize network capacities between nodes. In this paper, we propose a model segment level decentralized federated learning to tackle this problem. In particular, we propose a segmented gossip approach, which not only makes full utilization of node-to-node bandwidth, but also has good training convergence. The experimental results show that even the training time can be highly reduced as compared to centralized federated learning.

%\section{Introduction}
%
%The {\it IJCAI--19 Proceedings} will be printed from electronic
%manuscripts submitted by the authors. These must be PDF ({\em Portable
%Document Format}) files formatted for 8-1/2$''$ $\times$ 11$''$ paper.
%
%\subsection{Length of Papers}
%
%All paper {\em submissions} must have a maximum of six pages, plus at most one for references. The seventh page cannot contain {\bf anything} other than references.
%
%The length rules may change for final camera-ready versions of accepted papers, and will differ between tracks. Some tracks may include only references in the last page, whereas others allow for any content in all pages. Similarly, some tracks allow you to buy a few extra pages should you want to, whereas others don't.
%
%If your paper is accepted, please carefully read the notifications you receive, and check the proceedings submission information website\footnote{\url{https://proceedings.ijcai.org/info}} to know how many pages you can finally use (and whether there is a special references-only page or not). That website holds the most up-to-date information regarding paper length limits at all times.
%
%\subsection{Word Processing Software}
%
%As detailed below, IJCAI has prepared and made available a set of
%\LaTeX{} macros and a Microsoft Word template for use in formatting
%your paper. If you are using some other word processing software, please follow the format instructions given below and ensure that your final paper looks as much like this sample as possible.
%
%\section{Style and Format}
%
%\LaTeX{} and Word style files that implement these instructions
%can be retrieved electronically. (See Appendix~\ref{stylefiles} for
%instructions on how to obtain these files.)
%
%\subsection{Layout}
%
%Print manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner in which these
%instructions are printed. The exact dimensions for pages are:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item left and right margins: .75$''$
%\item column width: 3.375$''$
%\item gap between columns: .25$''$
%\item top margin---first page: 1.375$''$
%\item top margin---other pages: .75$''$
%\item bottom margin: 1.25$''$
%\item column height---first page: 6.625$''$
%\item column height---other pages: 9$''$
%\end{itemize}
%
%All measurements assume an 8-1/2$''$ $\times$ 11$''$ page size. For
%A4-size paper, use the given top and left margins, column width,
%height, and gap, and modify the bottom and right margins as necessary.
%
%\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
%
%For the production of the electronic manuscript, you must use Adobe's
%{\em Portable Document Format} (PDF). A PDF file can be generated, for
%instance, on Unix systems using {\tt ps2pdf} or on Windows systems
%using Adobe's Distiller. There is also a website with free software
%and conversion services: \url{http://www.ps2pdf.com}. For reasons of
%uniformity, use of Adobe's {\em Times Roman} font is strongly suggested. In
%\LaTeX2e{}, this is accomplished by putting
%\begin{quote} 
%\mbox{\tt $\backslash$usepackage\{times\}}
%\end{quote}
%in the preamble.\footnote{You may want also to use the package {\tt
%latexsym}, which defines all symbols known from the old \LaTeX{}
%version.}
%  
%Additionally, it is of utmost importance to specify the American {\bf
%letter} format (corresponding to 8-1/2$''$ $\times$ 11$''$) when
%formatting the paper. When working with {\tt dvips}, for instance, one
%should specify {\tt -t letter}.
%
%\subsection{Title and Author Information}
%
%Center the title on the entire width of the page in a 14-point bold
%font. The title should be capitalized using Title Case. Below it, center author name(s) in  12-point bold font. On the following line(s) place the affiliations, each affiliation on its own line using 12-point regular font. Matching between authors and affiliations can be done using numeric superindices. Optionally, a comma-separated list of email addresses follows the affiliation(s) line(s), using  12-point regular font.
%
%\subsubsection{Blind Review}
%
%In order to make blind reviewing possible, authors must omit their
%names and affiliations when submitting the paper for review. In place
%of names and affiliations, provide a list of content areas. When
%referring to one's own work, use the third person rather than the
%first person. For example, say, ``Previously,
%Gottlob~\shortcite{gottlob:nonmon} has shown that\ldots'', rather
%than, ``In our previous work~\cite{gottlob:nonmon}, we have shown
%that\ldots'' Try to avoid including any information in the body of the
%paper or references that would identify the authors or their
%institutions. Such information can be added to the final camera-ready
%version for publication.
%
%\subsection{Abstract}
%
%Place the abstract at the beginning of the first column 3$''$ from the
%top of the page, unless that does not leave enough room for the title
%and author information. Use a slightly smaller width than in the body
%of the paper. Head the abstract with ``Abstract'' centered above the
%body of the abstract in a 12-point bold font. The body of the abstract
%should be in the same font as the body of the paper.
%
%The abstract should be a concise, one-paragraph summary describing the
%general thesis and conclusion of your paper. A reader should be able
%to learn the purpose of the paper and the reason for its importance
%from the abstract. The abstract should be no more than 200 words long.
%
%\subsection{Text}
%
%The main body of the text immediately follows the abstract. Use
%10-point type in a clear, readable font with 1-point leading (10 on
%11).
%
%Indent when starting a new paragraph, except after major headings.
%
%\subsection{Headings and Sections}
%
%When necessary, headings should be used to separate major sections of
%your paper. (These instructions use many headings to demonstrate their
%appearance; your paper should have fewer headings.). All headings should be capitalized using Title Case.
%
%\subsubsection{Section Headings}
%
%Print section headings in 12-point bold type in the style shown in
%these instructions. Leave a blank space of approximately 10 points
%above and 4 points below section headings.  Number sections with
%arabic numerals.
%
%\subsubsection{Subsection Headings}
%
%Print subsection headings in 11-point bold type. Leave a blank space
%of approximately 8 points above and 3 points below subsection
%headings. Number subsections with the section number and the
%subsection number (in arabic numerals) separated by a
%period.
%
%\subsubsection{Subsubsection Headings}
%
%Print subsubsection headings in 10-point bold type. Leave a blank
%space of approximately 6 points above subsubsection headings. Do not
%number subsubsections.
%
%\paragraph{Titled paragraphs.} You can use titled paragraphs if and 
%only if the title covers exactly one paragraph. Such paragraphs must be
%separated from the preceding content by at least 3pt, and no more than
%6pt. The title must be in 10pt bold font and ended with a period. 
%After that, a 1em horizontal space must follow the title before 
%the paragraph's text.
%
%In \LaTeX{} titled paragraphs must be typeset using
%\begin{quote}
%{\tt \textbackslash{}paragraph\{Title.\} text} .
%\end{quote}
%
%\subsubsection{Acknowledgements}
%
%You may include an unnumbered acknowledgments section, including
%acknowledgments of help from colleagues, financial support, and
%permission to publish. If present, acknowledgements must be in a dedicated,
%unnumbered section appearing after all regular sections but before any
%appendices or references.
%
%Use 
%\begin{quote}
%    {\tt \textbackslash{}section*\{Acknowledgements\}})
%\end{quote}
%to typeset the acknowledgements section in \LaTeX{}.
%
%\subsubsection{Appendices}
%
%Any appendices directly follow the text and look like sections, except
%that they are numbered with capital letters instead of arabic
%numerals. See this document for an example.
%
%\subsubsection{References}
%
%The references section is headed ``References'', printed in the same
%style as a section heading but without a number. A sample list of
%references is given at the end of these instructions. Use a consistent
%format for references. The reference list should not include unpublished
%work.
%
%\subsection{Citations}
%
%Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
%the year of publication, for example~\cite{gottlob:nonmon}.  Append
%lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat multiple
%authors as in the following examples:~\cite{abelson-et-al:scheme}
%or~\cite{bgf:Lixto} (for more than two authors) and
%\cite{brachman-schmolze:kl-one} (for two authors).  If the author
%portion of a citation is obvious, omit it, e.g.,
%Nebel~\shortcite{nebel:jair-2000}.  Collapse multiple citations as
%follows:~\cite{gls:hypertrees,levesque:functional-foundations}.
%\nocite{abelson-et-al:scheme}
%\nocite{bgf:Lixto}
%\nocite{brachman-schmolze:kl-one}
%\nocite{gottlob:nonmon}
%\nocite{gls:hypertrees}
%\nocite{levesque:functional-foundations}
%\nocite{levesque:belief}
%\nocite{nebel:jair-2000}
%
%\subsection{Footnotes}
%
%Place footnotes at the bottom of the page in a 9-point font.  Refer to
%them with superscript numbers.\footnote{This is how your footnotes
%should appear.} Separate them from the text by a short
%line.\footnote{Note the line separating these footnotes from the
%text.} Avoid footnotes as much as possible; they interrupt the flow of
%the text.
%
%\section{Illustrations}
%
%Place all illustrations (figures, drawings, tables, and photographs)
%throughout the paper at the places where they are first discussed,
%rather than at the end of the paper.
%
%They should be floated to the top (preferred) or bottom of the page, 
%unless they are an integral part 
%of your narrative flow. When placed at the bottom or top of
%a page, illustrations may run across both columns, but not when they
%appear inline.
%
%Illustrations must be rendered electronically or scanned and placed
%directly in your document. All illustrations should be understandable when printed in black and
%white, albeit you can use colors to enhance them. Line weights should
%be 1/2-point or thicker. Avoid screens and superimposing type on
%patterns as these effects may not reproduce well.
%
%Number illustrations sequentially. Use references of the following
%form: Figure 1, Table 2, etc. Place illustration numbers and captions
%under illustrations. Leave a margin of 1/4-inch around the area
%covered by the illustration and caption.  Use 9-point type for
%captions, labels, and other text in illustrations. Captions should always appear below the illustration.
%
%\section{Tables}
%
%Tables are considered illustrations containing data. Therefore, they should also appear floated to the top (preferably) or bottom of the page, and with the captions below them.
%
%\begin{table}
%\centering
%\begin{tabular}{lll}
%\hline
%Scenario  & $\delta$ & Runtime \\
%\hline
%Paris       & 0.1s  & 13.65ms     \\
%Paris       & 0.2s  & 0.01ms      \\
%New York    & 0.1s  & 92.50ms     \\
%Singapore   & 0.1s  & 33.33ms     \\
%Singapore   & 0.2s  & 23.01ms     \\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\caption{Latex default table}
%\label{tab:plain}
%\end{table}
%
%\begin{table}
%\centering
%\begin{tabular}{lrr}  
%\toprule
%Scenario  & $\delta$ (s) & Runtime (ms) \\
%\midrule
%Paris       & 0.1  & 13.65      \\
%            & 0.2  & 0.01       \\
%New York    & 0.1  & 92.50      \\
%Singapore   & 0.1  & 33.33      \\
%            & 0.2  & 23.01      \\
%\bottomrule
%\end{tabular}
%\caption{Booktabs table}
%\label{tab:booktabs}
%\end{table}
%
%If you are using \LaTeX, you should use the {\tt booktabs} package, because it produces better tables than the standard ones. Compare Tables \ref{tab:plain} and~\ref{tab:booktabs}. The latter is clearly more readable for three reasons:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item The styling is better thanks to using the {\tt booktabs} rulers instead of the default ones.
%    \item Numeric columns are right-aligned, making it easier to compare the numbers. Make sure to also right-align the corresponding headers, and to use the same precision for all numbers.
%    \item We avoid unnecessary repetition, both between lines (no need to repeat the scenario name in this case) as well as in the content (units can be shown in the column header).
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\section{Formulas}
%
%IJCAI's two-column format makes it difficult to typeset long formulas. A usual temptation is to reduce the size of the formula by using the {\tt small} or {\tt tiny} sizes. This doesn't work correctly with the current \LaTeX{} versions, breaking the line spacing of the preceding paragraphs and title, as well as the equation number sizes. The following equation demonstrates the effects (notice that this entire paragraph looks badly formatted):
%%
%\begin{tiny}
%\begin{equation}
%    x = \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i
%\end{equation}
%\end{tiny}%
%
%Reducing formula sizes this way is strictly forbidden. We {\bf strongly} recommend authors to split formulas in multiple lines when they don't fit in a single line. This is the easiest approach to typeset those formulas and provides the most readable output%
%%
%\begin{align}
%    x =& \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \nonumber\\
%    + & \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i
%\end{align}%
%
%If a line is just slightly longer than the column width, you may use the {\tt resizebox} environment on that equation. The result looks better and doesn't interfere with the paragraph's line spacing: %
%\begin{equation}
%\resizebox{.91\linewidth}{!}{$
%    \displaystyle
%    x = \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i
%$}
%\end{equation}%
%
%This last solution may have to be adapted if you use different equation environments, but it can generally be made to work. Please notice that in any case:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Equation numbers must be in the same font and size than the main text (10pt).
%    \item Your formula's main symbols should not be smaller than {\small small} text (9pt).
%\end{itemize}
%
%For instance, the formula
%%
%\begin{equation}
%    \resizebox{.91\linewidth}{!}{$
%    \displaystyle
%    x = \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n j_i + \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n i_j
%$}
%\end{equation}
%% 
%would not be acceptable because the text is too small.
%
%\section{Algorithms and Listings}
%
%Algorithms and listings are a special kind of figures. Like all illustrations, they should appear floated to the top (preferably) or bottom of the page. However, their caption should appear in the header, left-justified and enclosed between horizontal lines, as shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:algorithm}. The algorithm body should be terminated with another horizontal line. It is up to the authors to decide whether to show line numbers or not, how to format comments, etc.
%
%In \LaTeX{} algorithms may be typeset using the {\tt algorithm} and {\tt algorithmic} packages, but you can also use one of the many other packages for the task.  
%
%\begin{algorithm}[tb]
%\caption{Example algorithm}
%\label{alg:algorithm}
%\textbf{Input}: Your algorithm's input\\
%\textbf{Parameter}: Optional list of parameters\\
%\textbf{Output}: Your algorithm's output
%\begin{algorithmic}[1] %[1] enables line numbers
%\STATE Let $t=0$.
%\WHILE{condition}
%\STATE Do some action.
%\IF {conditional}
%\STATE Perform task A.
%\ELSE
%\STATE Perform task B.
%\ENDIF
%\ENDWHILE
%\STATE \textbf{return} solution
%\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}
