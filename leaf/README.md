## Datasets

1. FEMNIST

  * **Overview:** Image Dataset
  * **Details:** 62 different classes (10 digits, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase), images are 28 by 28 pixels (with option to make them all 128 by 128 pixels), 3500 users
  * **Task:** Image Classification

2. Sentiment140

  * **Overview:** Text Dataset of Tweets
  * **Details** 660120 users
  * **Task:** Sentiment Analysis

3. Shakespeare

  * **Overview:** Text Dataset of Shakespeare Dialogues
  * **Details:** 2288 users
  * **Task:** Next-Character Prediction

4. Celeba

  * **Overview:** Image Dataset based on the [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
  * **Details:** 9343 users (we exclude celebrities with less than 5 images)
  * **Task:** Image Classification (Smiling vs. Not smiling)

5. Synthetic Dataset

  * **Overview:** We propose a process to generate synthetic, challenging federated datasets. The high-level goal is to create devices whose true models are device-dependant. To see a description of the whole generative process, please refer to the paper
  * **Details:** The user can customize the number of devices, the number of classes and the number of dimensions, among others
  * **Task:** Classification

## Notes

- Install the libraries listed in ```requirements.txt```
    - I.e. with pip: run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
- Go to directory of respective dataset for instructions on generating data
- ```models``` directory contains instructions on running baseline reference implementations
